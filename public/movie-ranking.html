<h2>Howl's Moving Castle</h2>
<p>One of my favorite Studio Ghibli movies</p>

<h2>Greenland</h2>
<p>A super duper good thriller world-end type of movie, I stand by it it's so good</p>

<h2>A Quiet Place 1 and 2</h2>
<p>
A Quiet Place is so damn good, both movies.<br />
A third one is coming out so I hope it's a good as the first two.<br />
It's not often that you'd see one movie having a sequal as good as the first movie. <br />
pretty cool, pretty cool.<br />
